# What is Study App?
Is an aplication build for learning purposes usign .NET MAUI. 

## Features
* The backend is programmed completely in C#.
* The frontend is based on XAML.

## About the proyect
This project is a first approach to .NET and multiplatform apps.
The application is based on a main page with a summary of the study techniques used. Then you can extend flyout items in the left area of the screen that allows us to navigate between two pages.
* The first page uses the Pomodoro technique. A work/study time is set, and based on that time a rest time is defined.
* The second page uses Flow Time as a study technique. This technique is more flexible in work and rest times because the duration of a set is defined in real time by the user, which allows having blocks with heterogeneous durations.

## Objective of the project
The main objective of the project is to learn the use of cross-platform technologies, differences between backend and frontend languages (XAML and C# respectively) and a first approach to exporting a project in different executable formats.
